# Learning Management System

A fullstack Learning Management System (LMS) built with Next.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and modern frontend technologies. This project enables educators to create, manage, and deliver online courses, while providing students with an interactive and engaging learning experience.

The frontend and backend have distinct code layers within one Next.js deployment. See [the architecture guide](docs/architecture.md) for request flow, dependency rules, and how to add features.

The new multi-teacher Supabase database foundation is documented in
[database architecture](docs/database-architecture.md). Versioned SQL is in
`supabase/migrations/`, development fixtures in `supabase/seed.sql`, and executable
RLS checks in `supabase/tests/authorization.sql`. Typed browser/server Supabase
clients use the public URL and publishable key from `.env.local` (see `.env.example`).
The existing UI still uses Clerk/Prisma until the explicit identity/data cutover.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 22 (required by the current Supabase client)
- PostgreSQL database
- [Mux](https://mux.com/) and [Clerk](https://clerk.dev/) accounts for full functionality

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shounoop/learning-management-system.git
cd learning-management-system
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

```
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_connection_string
DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED=your_direct_postgres_connection_string
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
MUX_TOKEN_ID=your_mux_token_id
MUX_TOKEN_SECRET=your_mux_token_secret
UPLOADTHING_TOKEN=your_uploadthing_token
```

### Database Setup

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Running Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

On Windows, the npm scripts preload a narrow filesystem compatibility fix for
exFAT drives: Node reports `EISDIR` when reading a non-symlink, while Next.js expects
`EINVAL`. The fix verifies that the path is not a link before normalizing this error;
other errors are preserved. This avoids the [known exFAT build issue](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/38785)
when running this checkout on `D:`. Linux/macOS behavior is unchanged.

Run `npm run check` for backend/architecture tests, dependency checks, TypeScript,
and lint. Run `npm run build` to validate a production build; it also enforces
the frontend/backend boundaries.

The website remains on Clerk/Prisma/UploadThing. Supabase LMS access is prepared
behind a disabled staging flag until the separate identity migration. Read the
[verified Supabase report](docs/supabase-completion-report.md),
[operations guide](docs/database-operations.md),
[identity transition](docs/identity-transition.md), and
[legacy migration mapping](docs/legacy-data-migration.md).
`npm run test:lms-http` checks anonymous/token API boundaries; the opt-in
`npm run test:lms-load` requires dedicated real development sessions.

## Contribution

Dependency remediation is documented in the [security report](docs/dependency-security-report.md)
and [complete advisory inventory](docs/dependency-advisory-inventory.md).
For the read-only local runtime checks, start a production build with
`npm run start -- --hostname localhost --port 3108`, then run
`npm run test:security-smoke` in another terminal. Use Node 22 or newer.

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request.
